# Overview

The LDAP Integration CUBA component provides a readily available instrument for employing features of a directory
server, e.g. Active Directory, in any CUBA-based application.
The component is available for CUBA applications of any complexity and does not require any additional third-party 
frameworks or libraries to be installed.

The component comprises the following functionalities:

* Storing user credentials in the LDAP database;
* Using Single Sign-On without having to specify user credentials;
* Configuring LDAP parameters and the directory server schema;
* Setting up rules for assigning roles and access groups to users.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Before enabling the component, it is required to configure a directory server, so that it was accessible for the 
component features, and set up LDAP connection parameters.

## Installation

To add the LDAP component to your project, the following steps should be taken:

1. Add a custom application component to your project via CUBA Studio.

* Artifact group: *com.haulmont.addon.ldap*
* Artifact name: *ldap-global*
* Version: *add-on version*

When specifying the component version, you should select the one, which is compatible with the platform version used
in your project.

| Platform Version | Component Version |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 6.8.1            | 0.1-SNAPSHOT      |

2. Before using the component as a part of your application, it is vital to configure initial values for connecting to
the LDAP server, and to set up basic attribute names for the LDAP user in the *app.property* file.
An example of how to set up these properties is given below.

```properties
ldap.contextSourceUrl = ldap://localhost:10389
ldap.contextSourceBase = dc=example,dc=com
ldap.contextSourceUserName = uid=admin,ou=system
ldap.contextSourcePassword = secret
```

## Additional Information

You should keep in mind, that the LDAP component should be installed for each CUBA application, which is expected to use
Single Sign-On.
